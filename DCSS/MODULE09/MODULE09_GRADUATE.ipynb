My recommendation is that you check the relevant parts of the assigned reading or search for inspiration on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n",
    "- **Each problem is worth 1 point**. All problems are equally weighted.\n",
    "- **The information you need for each problem set is provided in the blue and green cells.** General instructions / the problem set preamble are in the blue cells, and instructions for specific problems are in the green cells. **You have to execute all of the code in the problem set, but you are only responsible for entering code into the code cells that immediately follow a green cell**. You will also recognize those cells because they will be incomplete. You need to replace each `____` with the code that will make the cell execute properly.\n",
    "- **The comments in the problem cells contain clues indicating what the following line of code is supposed to do.** Use these comments as a guide when filling in the blanks. \n",
    "- **Each problem cell stores one object named according to the problem (e.g. _09)**. These are not important for you, but we use them to help grade your work efficiently, so **do not delete them or change their names**. If you do, you will lose marks.\n",
    "- **You can ask for help**. If you run into problems, you can reach out to John (john.mclevey@uwaterloo.ca) or Pierson (pbrowne@uwaterloo.ca) for help. You can ask a friend for help if you like, regardless of whether they are enrolled in the course.\n",

    "    <li> You have a gregarious cat named Solomon for whom the undisupted highlight of each day is wet food feeding time. You give him his wet food every evening at 9:00pm sharp, and you always feed him in the kitchen. Solomon has a well-tuned internal clock, and can usually be found waiting in the kitchen (very impatiently) up to 10 minutes before scheduled mealtimes. Sometimes, however, Solomon will be elsewhere in the house -- blissfully asleep -- when 9:00pm rolls around. The moment he hears you pick up a tin of cat food, he'll immediately start scrambling towards the kitchen at breakneck speed. Amused by his behaviour, you have decided to describe the amount of time it takes for Solomon to appear in the kitchen after 9:00pm using a random variable $\\text{TUS}$ (which stands for \"Time Until Solomon\"). You measure this time by starting a stopwatch the moment you pick up a can of wet cat food (precisely at 9:00pm), and stop the stopwatch as soon as Solomon enters the kitchen. On most days, $\\text{TUS} =$ 0, because Solomon is already in the kitchen, but on other days, the amount of time it takes him depends on where in the house he's sleeping and how sleepy he is. He's more likely to sleep in rooms close to the kitchen than he is in rooms further away. What is the distribution of $\\text{TUS}$?\n",

One of his favourite daytime activities is to sit at the screen door and yowl loudly for minutes on end, hoping to convince you to let him out (it hasn't worked yet, and you're pretty sure it never will). Amused by your use of probability distributions to describe your cat's idiosyncratic behaviour (and lacking anything better to do during COVID lockdown), you decide to describe the amount of time Solomon spends yowling at the door using a random variable $\\text{YD}$ (which stands for \"Yowls Duration\"). On days when Solomon decides to have a yowling session, you'd say that -- on average -- he spends about 20 minutes making a ruckus, but that number is about equally likely to be higher or lower on any given day.

In this question, we're going to ask you to take your question 9 model a bit further by turning it into a hierarchical model, using <code>region</code> as the clustering variable. In the textbook, we accounted for the influence of the group-level variables on both the intercept (Î±) and one of the coefficients (Î²_spend). For this question, you're only going to have to split your model's intercept <code>Î±</code> into 4, using the technique we showed you in the textbook. <br><br>\n",

Spend some time tweaking your priors (and potentially replacing your Exponential distributions with Gamma distributions) until your divergences are down to a reasonable level; say, fewer than 10. We've tweaked some of the other settings for you which will help settle your model down (at the expense of it taking a bit longer to sample). Normally, even a single divergence would call a model's validity into question, but we'll let it slide this time. Once you've gotten a well-behaved model, be sure to examine the trace plots to confirm that everything is okay, and then feel free to move onto question 12! \n",
