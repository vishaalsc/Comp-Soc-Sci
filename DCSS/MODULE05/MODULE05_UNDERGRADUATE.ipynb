My recommendation is that you check the relevant parts of the assigned reading or search for inspiration on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n",
    "- **Each problem is worth 1 point**. All problems are equally weighted.\n",
    "- **The information you need for each problem set is provided in the blue and green cells.** General instructions / the problem set preamble are in the blue cells, and instructions for specific problems are in the green cells. **You have to execute all of the code in the problem set, but you are only responsible for entering code into the code cells that immediately follow a green cell**. You will also recognize those cells because they will be incomplete. You need to replace each `____` with the code that will make the cell execute properly.\n",
    "- **The comments in the problem cells contain clues indicating what the following line of code is supposed to do.** Use these comments as a guide when filling in the blanks. \n",
    "- **Each problem cell stores one object named according to the problem (e.g. _09)**. These are not important for you, but we use them to help grade your work efficiently, so **do not delete them or change their names**. If you do, you will lose marks.\n",
    "- **You can ask for help**. If you run into problems, you can reach out to John (john.mclevey@uwaterloo.ca) or Pierson (pbrowne@uwaterloo.ca) for help. You can ask a friend for help if you like, regardless of whether they are enrolled in the course.\n",

    "In this notebook, we're going to return to the topic of Python programming skills. Our objective in doing so is to strengthen your understanding of three aspects involved in almost all Python Programming: (1) creating callable functions from scratch, (2) using functions you've written inside other functions you're writing, and (3) using external sources of information to fill in the gaps in your knowledge. All of these aspects are very important, but the latter of the three can be counterintuitive at first. Normally, university courses establish the expectation that you, as a student, won't be formally assessed on any domain-specific knowledge that isn't contained in the course materials themselves. That's not going to be the case here; some of the things we're going to ask you to do are not in the textbook or course readings. In this notebook, our objective is to help you develop an intuition for how you can find information about Python (and the countless legions of indispensible packages that have been developed for it) as the need emerges. Three good places to start looking for answers are:\n",

Rather than writing the code to do this from scratch, use the function you wrote for Question 1!

If you've spent any time at all in the 'Programmer Humour' subreddit, you've probably seen more than your fair share of memes about 'recursion', which is just a term used to describe functions or methods which refer to themselves. Despite all of the (apparently exasperated) press it seems to get, recursion is both simple to understand and incredibly useful!\n",

Your function should perform the following steps, in order: (1) remove the first word from the list of strings and check to see if it is identical to the word passed in as the 'term' argument, (2a) if it is, return the remainder of the list of strings; or (2b) if it is not, call this function again, passing the remainder of the sentence (as a list of strings) and the term to it. If your function runs out of words before it finds the term it is looking for, or ever attempts to return a list with 0 words, it should return 'None'. \n",
