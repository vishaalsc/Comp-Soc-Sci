    "- **You can consult any resources you want when completing these exercises and problems**. Just as it is in the \"real world:\" if you can't figure out how to do something, look it up. My recommendation is that you check the relevant parts of the assigned reading or search for inspiration on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n",
    "- **Each problem is worth 1 point**. All problems are equally weighted.\n",
    "- **The information you need for each problem set is provided in the blue and green cells.** General instructions / the problem set preamble are in the blue cells, and instructions for specific problems are in the green cells. **You have to execute all of the code in the problem set, but you are only responsible for entering code into the code cells that immediately follow a green cell**. You will also recognize those cells because they will be incomplete. You need to replace each `____` with the code that will make the cell execute properly.\n",
    "- **The comments in the problem cells contain clues indicating what the following line of code is supposed to do.** Use these comments as a guide when filling in the blanks. \n",
    "- **Each problem cell stores one object named according to the problem (e.g. _09)**. These are not important for you, but we use them to help grade your work efficiently, so **do not delete them or change their names**. If you do, you will lose marks.\n",
    "- **You can ask for help**. If you run into problems, you can reach out to John (john.mclevey@uwaterloo.ca) or Pierson (pbrowne@uwaterloo.ca) for help. You can ask a friend for help if you like, regardless of whether they are enrolled in the course.\n",

You can also select 'Restart and Run All' from the Kernel dropdown menu. If the entire notebook runs without throwing any errors, you should be good to go!\n",

If you change an answer's variable name or don't store your answer in that variable, the project won't finalize properly and you won't get proper credit for your work. The same goes for the `student_id` metadata variable we ask you to complete immediately below; if any of those are missing, haven't been filled in properly, or have been renamed, issues may arise during the grading process and you will not receive proper credit.

In the second phase, you're going to think through all of the people you included in your ego network and add links between those who interacted directly with one another.

Don't include any more than 20 names in this network (although the same name can appear more than once, so there may be more than 20 lines in your dictionary). You don't need to include both sides of a network tie (i.e. <code>{\"Me\": [\"My Dog\", \"My Cat\"]}</code> is enough to build a two-way tie between me and my cat; I DON'T need to then create an entry like <code>{\"My Cat\": [\"Me\"]}</code>, although doing so won't do any harm).

Zachary collected this data in the context of a 3 year anthropological ethnography in the early 1970s. During that period, the nodes in the network were involved in a heated disagreement over how much to charge for karate lessons and how to compensate the instructor. This evolved into an intense political conflict that divided the club into two factions. Over time, the factionalized structure of the network was exacerbated by the informal flow of information through friendship networks, leading each faction to know less about the other and less about what they had in common over time, until eventually the club split into two clubs. On the basis of this work, Zachary proposed a (then) new mathematical model of how network structures shape the diffusion of political information, and how conflicts unfold in small groups over time.<br>\n",

Compare the resulting list with the list of the top ten nodes as measured by degree centrality (from the previous question). Write between three and five sentences detailing why the two lists might differ, with a particular focus on the latter half of each list. Be specific about the network in question (Karate Club network), the nodes in question, and the measures we're using. You won't recieve full credit for this question unless you succinctly explain how each of the two measures produces a different outcome from the other.\n",
