Hunter Tootoo (Nunavut, Ind.)",,Statements By Members,Nunavut Elections,,"  Qujannamiik Uqaqti, Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this time to congratulate Nunavut's newly elected MLAs, Speaker, executive council, and new Premier, Paul Quassa.
 As I am sure all members in this House can agree, an incredible amount of work goes into an election. I would like to congratulate them again on their hard work and achievements thus far.
 This is an important time for Nunavut. With our 20-year anniversary fast approaching, we reflect on how we have grown as a territory, the progress we have made, and the lessons we have learned. We use this knowledge to determine how to best move forward as we look to the future. 
With the fastest growing population in Canada, many of the challenges we face, including education, housing, and health care, are only going to become more pressing. Addressing these issues is vital to securing a bright future for Nunavut. I look forward to working closely with the new territorial government and Premier Quassa to help ensure that Nunavut shines.",Independent,Nunavut,Hunter Tootoo,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/hunter-tootoo(214600)

Their Gros Morne Theatre Festival, in Gros Morne National Park, is now the economic backbone of the community of Cow Head. According to Mayor Adrian Payne, things did not look so great for the former fishing community, but theatre swept in, and now the town is a cultural destination for locals and tourists alike.
 I was excited to be with Adrian and others to announce combined funding of $4.2 million to construct a new dinner theatre and a production complex. Everyone is applauding the investment, as audiences have grown from 1,200 to over 12,000, and they turn away people every night.
 TNL is known for exceptional experiences, talented performers, and magical technicians. However, they are especially known for theatre based on our incredible local Newfoundland and Labrador stories. The entire region is excited about the expansion, the construction, the new jobs, and the opening in 2019.

We somehow believe that these things will bring us happiness. They ultimately never do.
 As Christmas approaches, may we rather focus on the birth of Jesus and be reminded of His unchanging message of hope, peace, and love. In a world at times absent of love, at times absent of peace, it may seem hopeless and discouraging, but let us remember the message given to the shepherds.
 The angel declared, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
Jesus, “Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.”
 As parliamentarians, let us remember the foundation of our dominion. May we remain ever hopeful, ever faithful to the promise that is Canada, and turn to the Prince of Peace for guidance and direction in whatever we do in this place. He is the one who has dominion from sea to sea.
I would like to take this opportunity to wish the members of this House and all Canadians—",Conservative,Provencher,Ted Falk,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/ted-falk(218245)

Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh have had the longest marriage in the history of the British Crown. This is another joyful milestone for our head of state. Last year, Her Majesty became the first reigning Canadian monarch to reach 90 years of age.
 The Globe and Mail stated last July that “The monarchy is the bedrock of Canada's constitutional order.” I firmly agree, and I have always believed that.
I am proud to be a strong monarchist, holding firm to the belief that historical continuity is the best anchor for bold and progressive governance.
I would like to express my sincere hope that Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh will continue to be beacons of love and devotion for years to come.

Well, he broke his promise and is now working to ram this dangerous new bitumen pipeline through our beautiful province. While 18 court cases have left the fate of this pipeline in limbo, Kinder Morgan has already broken the law by setting up salmon-killing anti-spawning matting in our rivers, with plans to set up more in dozens of locations. The National Energy Board has issued stop work orders, and my inquiries indicate that the BC Oil and Gas Commission will also officially sanction the company.
 Kinder Morgan has erected a Guantanamo Bay-style compound in the Burrard Inlet, complete with razor-wire fencing. The company's private security firm harasses recreational boaters on a daily basis, and I have now asked the RCMP to investigate. 
While the Prime Minister and his Liberal MPs have sided with Kinder Morgan against B.C., we will not stop fighting this project until it is abandoned. We will protect our coast.",New Democratic Party,Burnaby South,Kennedy Stewart,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/kennedy-stewart(214215)
