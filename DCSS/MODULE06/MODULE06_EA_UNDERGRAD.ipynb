    "- **You can consult any resources you want when completing these exercises and problems**. Just as it is in the \"real world:\" if you can't figure out how to do something, look it up. My recommendation is that you check the relevant parts of the assigned reading or search for inspiration on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n",
    "- **Each problem is worth 1 point**. All problems are equally weighted.\n",
    "- **The information you need for each problem set is provided in the blue and green cells.** General instructions / the problem set preamble are in the blue cells, and instructions for specific problems are in the green cells. **You have to execute all of the code in the problem set, but you are only responsible for entering code into the code cells that immediately follow a green cell**. You will also recognize those cells because they will be incomplete. You need to replace each `____` with the code that will make the cell execute properly.\n",
    "- **The comments in the problem cells contain clues indicating what the following line of code is supposed to do.** Use these comments as a guide when filling in the blanks. \n",
    "- **Each problem cell stores one object named according to the problem (e.g. _09)**. These are not important for you, but we use them to help grade your work efficiently, so **do not delete them or change their names**. If you do, you will lose marks.\n",
    "- **You can ask for help**. If you run into problems, you can reach out to John (john.mclevey@uwaterloo.ca) or Pierson (pbrowne@uwaterloo.ca) for help. You can ask a friend for help if you like, regardless of whether they are enrolled in the course.\n",

    "Finally, remember that you do not need to \"master\" this content before moving on to other course materials, as what is introduced here is reinforced throughout the rest of the course. You will have plenty of time to practice and cement your new knowledge and skills."

    "Since we've had to rethink the way we deliver, collect, and evaluate these problem sets, we want to be very clear about what you need to do to properly submit this module notebook assignment. Please read the following explanation of our process so that you understand how this works, and what you need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very end of this notebook, there is a code cell that will compile all of your answers to every problem in the assignment and save them as a 'pickle' file (`.pkl`) in the current working directory. You can execute that cell as many times as you like. Each time you run it, it will overwrite the old pickle with your updated answers. **Once you've ensured that everything in the notebook is complete and finished to your satisfaction, it's up to you to get the pickle that you just created and upload it to the appropriate Learn dropbox for this module.** The file you are looking for will not exist until you run the cells at the end of the notebook. Once it has been created, it will follow this naming convention: \n",

    "\n",
    "It's generally a good idea to do a 'fresh' run of your entire notebook before you submit your assignment to make sure that everything is working as it should be. You can use the button with the 'Fast-Forward' arrows in the Jupyter toolbar above to restart the kernel (resetting everything to initial conditions) and running every code cell in the notebook, in order. You can also select 'Restart and Run All' from the Kernel dropdown menu. If the entire notebook runs without throwing any errors, you should be good to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running into issues, make sure that you haven't changed any of the 'answer' variable names we provided you with (e.g., we asked you to store your answer to the first question in a variable called `_01`). If you change an answer's variable name or don't store your answer in that variable, the project won't finalize properly and you won't get proper credit for your work. The same goes for the `student_id` metadata variable we ask you to complete immediately below; if any of those are missing, haven't been filled in properly, or have been renamed, issues may arise during the grading process and you will not receive proper credit. So make sure you enter your student information, and don't delete or change the names of the variables that store your answers to each problem!"
