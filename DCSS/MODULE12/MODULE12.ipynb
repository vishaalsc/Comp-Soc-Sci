You can execute that cell as many times as you like. Each time you run it, it will overwrite the old pickle with your updated answers. **Once you've ensured that everything in the notebook is complete and finished to your satisfaction, it's up to you to get the pickle that you just created and upload it to the appropriate Learn dropbox for this module.** The file you are looking for will not exist until you run the cells at the end of the notebook.

    "It's generally a good idea to do a 'fresh' run of your entire notebook before you submit your assignment to make sure that everything is working as it should be. You can use the button with the 'Fast-Forward' arrows in the Jupyter toolbar above to restart the kernel (resetting everything to initial conditions) and running every code cell in the notebook, in order. You can also select 'Restart and Run All' from the Kernel dropdown menu. If the entire notebook runs without throwing any errors, you should be good to go!\n",

    "If you're running into issues, make sure that you haven't changed any of the 'answer' variable names we provided you with (e.g., we asked you to store your answer to the first question in a variable called `_01`). If you change an answer's variable name or don't store your answer in that variable, the project won't finalize properly and you won't get proper credit for your work. The same goes for the `student_id` metadata variable we ask you to complete immediately below; if any of those are missing, haven't been filled in properly, or have been renamed, issues may arise during the grading process and you will not receive proper credit. So make sure you enter your student information, and don't delete or change the names of the variables that store your answers to each problem!"
