INTEG 440, INTEG 640, SOC 440, SOC 719

This repo contains the student version of module assignments for my class Doing Computational Social Science at the University of Waterloo, Winter 2021.

These notebook assignments were developed collaboratively by John McLevey, Pierson Browne, Tyler Crick, and Sasha Graham and are intended to accompany assigned readings from John McLevey (2021) *Doing Computational Social Science* London, UK: Sage.
